# About me

I am an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence in Animal Omics Sciences in the [Department of Animal Sciences](https://animal.ifas.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). My research group ([AIAOS](https://uf-aiaos.github.io/)) primarily focuses on integrating high-dimensional heterogeneous -omics data to advance agriculture using statistical modeling, machine learning, and computational methods. 

<!--
I am a postdoctoral research associate in [Dr. Jack Dekkers' lab](https://www.ans.iastate.edu/people/jack-c-dekkers) in the Department of Animal Science at Iowa State University. My postdoc research focuses on developing Bayesian Hierarchical models and artificial neural networks to integrate nutritional growth models into genomic evaluations of pigs. My Ph.D. work in [Dr. Gota Morotaâ€™s lab](http://morotalab.org/) at Virginia Tech centered on designing and modeling high-throughput phenotyping data in quantitative genetics. My overall research interests are integrating high-dimensional heterogeneous data to advance the genetic improvement of animals and plants using statistical modeling, machine learning, and computational methods. 


<font color=#F1BE48><b>I will be joining the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Florida as an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence in Animal Omics Sciences starting August 2022.</b></font>
